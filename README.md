# ExpressNoteTaker

The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize myself with api routes to finish an express note making program that allows the user to write notes on the browser and see a history of other notes

This involves uuid, path, id, and a db.json where my notes are stores as an array of objects.

The user will be able to open the server.js with localhost:6358 and be able to use the program.
Previous notes can be accessed by clicking on them on the left side

Delete function to be implemented later
